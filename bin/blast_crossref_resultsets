#  List the results of a BLAST XML file (-m7) by hits. The BLAST file is post-
#  processed to find all hits with their original searches. All results are
#  parsed and each sequence that is hit is listed with the original search
#  sequences it matches (cross-referencing hits).
#
#  So if BLAST queries with sequence Q1, Q2 and Q3 are executed each of these
#  returns a result set containing hits. If a hit H is shared between queries
#  Q2 and Q3 it will be listed like:
#
#  H: Q2 Q3
#
#  and so on for all hits.
#
#  This can be useful when BLASTing datasets against themselves. Rather then
#  having to BLAST all hits again to find their homologues.
#
#  If the XML file is large it may be worth splitting it with the
#  blast_split_xml script (BioRuby loads the full DOM into RAM).
#
#  Usage:
#
#     blast_crossref_resultsets xmlfile(s) > by_hit.csv
